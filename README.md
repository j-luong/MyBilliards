# MyBilliards

My final year university project involved programming a physically accurate simulation of a game of pool.
In this project I used C++ and OpenGL to apply maths and physics principles such as:

* Linear and angular motion
* Conservation of linear and conservation of angular momentum
* Collision detection techniques
* Collision response techniques, including oblique collision response techniques which were used to determine the collision response of two colliding balls

As well as researching and applying these principles, I also implemented a finite state machine to handle game states, such as accessing the help screen, handling fouls and determining winning/losing conditions.
